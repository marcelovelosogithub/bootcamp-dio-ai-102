    "\n",
    "## Introdução\n",
    "\n",
    "Este sistema foi desenvolvido para extrair informações de cartões de crédito a partir de imagens usando o serviço Azure Document Intelligence da Microsoft. É como ter um assistente que olha para a foto de um cartão de crédito e anota todas as informações importantes dele.\n",
    "\n",
    "## O que é @dataclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicação Simples\n",
    "Imagine que você está organizando uma festa e precisa anotar informações dos convidados. Você poderia criar uma ficha com campos como nome, idade e telefone. O `@dataclass` é como um \"modelo de ficha\" no Python que facilita a criação dessas estruturas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exemplo Prático\n",
    "Sem @dataclass:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Convidado:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, nome, idade, telefone):\n",
    "        self.nome = nome\n",
    "        self.idade = idade\n",
    "        self.telefone = telefone\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Com @dataclass:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Convidado:\n",
    "    nome: str\n",
    "    idade: int\n",
    "    telefone: str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vantagens do @dataclass\n",
    "1. **Menos código**: Você escreve menos e tem o mesmo resultado\n",
    "2. **Mais organizado**: A estrutura fica mais clara e fácil de entender\n",
    "3. **Automático**: Python cria automaticamente vários métodos úteis\n",
    "4. **Tipagem**: Ajuda a prevenir erros indicando o tipo de cada campo\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Nosso Código\n",
    "Usamos @dataclass para criar a estrutura que guarda as informações do cartão:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class CreditCardInfo:\n",
    "    card_name: Optional[str] = None    # Nome no cartão\n",
    "    card_number: Optional[str] = None  # Número do cartão\n",
    "    expiry_date: Optional[str] = None  # Data de validade\n",
    "    bank_name: Optional[str] = None    # Nome do banco\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Componentes do Sistema\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. CreditCardInfo (A Ficha)\n",
    "- Guarda as informações extraídas do cartão\n",
    "- Cada informação pode estar presente ou ser None (opcional)\n",
    "- Campos são tipados para evitar erros\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. CreditCardDetector (O Detector)\n",
    "- Classe principal que faz todo o trabalho\n",
    "- Conecta com o Azure\n",
    "- Processa a imagem\n",
    "- Extrai as informações\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Factory Function (O Criador)\n",
    "- Função que prepara e configura o detector\n",
    "- Verifica se tudo está correto antes de começar\n",
    "- Facilita a criação de novas instâncias\n",
    "\n",
    "## Como Funciona\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preparação**:\n",
    "   - Sistema se conecta ao Azure usando suas credenciais\n",
    "   - Valida se a URL da imagem é válida\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processamento**:\n",
    "   - Envia a imagem para o Azure\n",
    "   - Azure analisa a imagem usando IA\n",
    "   - Extrai as informações do cartão\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resultado**:\n",
    "   - Organiza as informações encontradas\n",
    "   - Retorna um objeto CreditCardInfo preenchido\n",
    "   - Trata possíveis erros\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuração\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pré-requisitos\n",
    "1. Conta no Azure\n",
    "2. Serviço Document Intelligence configurado\n",
    "3. Python instalado\n",
    "4. Bibliotecas necessárias\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arquivo de Configuração\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tratamento de Erros\n",
    "\n",
    "O sistema trata vários tipos de erros:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Erros de Configuração**:\n",
    "   - Credenciais ausentes\n",
    "   - Configuração incorreta\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Erros de URL**:\n",
    "   - URL inválida\n",
    "   - Imagem inacessível\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Erros de Processamento**:\n",
    "   - Falha na análise\n",
    "   - Timeout\n",
    "   - Problemas de rede\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perguntas Frequentes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Por que usar async/await?\n",
    "Para melhor performance com múltiplas requisições e para não travar o programa enquanto processa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. O sistema é seguro?\n",
    "Sim, usa credenciais do Azure e validações de segurança.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Que tipos de imagem são aceitos?\n",
    "JPG, PNG e outros formatos comuns de imagem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Preciso de internet?\n",
    "Sim, o sistema usa o Azure, que é um serviço online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. O que significa Optional[str]?\n",
    "Significa que o campo pode ter um texto (str) ou ser vazio (None).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dicas de Uso\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sempre trate erros**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       resultado = await detector.detect_credit_card_info(url)\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Ops, algo deu errado: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verifique os resultados**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if info.card_number:\n",
    "       print(\"Número encontrado!\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Número não encontrado\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use boas imagens**:\n",
    "   - Boa iluminação\n",
    "   - Sem reflexos\n",
    "   - Cartão bem visível\n",

    "* **`flake8`:** Verifica seu código em busca de erros de sintaxe, erros de estilo e convenções de código que podem levar a problemas de manutenção. Ele também identifica código morto e possíveis problemas de segurança.\n",

    "* **Economiza tempo:** Automatiza tarefas repetitivas de formatação e verificação, liberando você para se concentrar em escrever código.\n",
